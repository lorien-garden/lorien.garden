## Meaning and Belonging in a Time Between Worlds

Lórien is a Salt Lake City, UT based peer-support community that draws on principles from [Microsolidarity](https://microsolidarity.cc).

Our intention is to create the conditions for belonging and to support each other in co-creation of beauty and art.

Come together with us to create a sense of coziness and home.
